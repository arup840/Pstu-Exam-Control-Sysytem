# Pstu-Exam-Control-Sysytem
This is my university final year project. It's a web based exam control system of PSTU.

The project folder is needed to be imported into an IDE like netbeans to run to whole project. The codes of the files also can be edited by other editors.
There are 5 databases to run this large project.
