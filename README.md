# Pstu-Exam-Control-Sysytem
This is my university final year project. It's a web based exam control system of PSTU.

The project folder is needed to be imported into an IDE like netbeans to run to whole project. The codes of the files also can be edited by other editors.
There are 5 databases to run this large project.Technologies used in this project are Java, JSP, SQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript etc.
There are two modules. Teacher module and admin module. Most of the login details are different for different each course codes. You can find the code and password from the database and also the admin login details.
